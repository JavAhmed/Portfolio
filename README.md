# Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of data analysis and data visualization projects showcasing my transition from a background in corporate communications to a career in data analysis. These projects highlight my proficiency in Python programming, SQL, data cleaning, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques acquired through a comprehensive Data Science Bootcamp at HyperionDev. Each project demonstrates my ability to leverage data to derive meaningful insights and support strategic decision-making.
